<P ALIGN="CENTER">ABSTRACT</P></B>
<FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This dissertation presents an investigation into the problem of object-oriented framework design and instantiation. A new method that uses the concepts of viewpoints and domain-specific languages is proposed to address this problem. The method process is formally described and case studies are presented. This proposal motivates the problem and outlines how the dissertation will address it.</P></FONT>

<FONT SIZE=2>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are various application areas that are not established yet and for which new ideas and models are presently under development and evaluation. These are domains in which the possibility of rapidly building new applications is essential and strategic from a practical point of view. Examples of application domains that can be classified in this category include Web-based Education, electronic commerce, biology, and financial market.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An interesting strategy for developing new applications for these domains is the development of object-oriented application frameworks [10, 13]. Frameworks can reduce the costs of developing applications since it allows designers and implementers to reuse their previous experience with problem solving at the design and code levels. Prior research has shown that high levels of software reuse can be achieved through the use of object-oriented frameworks. An object-oriented framework captures the common aspects of a family of applications, which can be seen as a domain theory [19]. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although object-oriented software development has experienced the benefits of using frameworks, a thorough understanding of how to identify, design, implement, and change them to meet evolving requirement needs is still object of research [24]. Techniques such as design patterns [10, 17], meta-object protocol [15], refactoring [14], and class reorganization [3] have been proposed to support framework development and cope with some of the challenges.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefore, framework development is very expensive not only because of the intrinsic difficulty related to capturing the domain theory but also because of the lack of appropriate methods and techniques to support framework specification and design. </P>

<B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2. PROPOSED SOLUTION </P></B></FONT>

<FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This dissertation proposes a new method for object-oriented framework design and instantiation. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In [19] Roberts and Johnson state that "Developing reusable frameworks cannot occur by simply sitting down and thinking about the problem domain. No one has the insight to come up with the proper abstractions." They propose the development of concrete examples in order to understand the domain. The design strategy presented here is quite similar, analyzing concrete applications as viewpoints [8, 6] of a domain and deriving the final framework from the analysis of these viewpoints.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The approach to framework design is based on the idea that any design can be divided into two parts: the kernel sub-system design and the hot-spot sub-system design. The kernel sub-system design is common to all the applications that the framework may generate, and the hot-spot sub-system design describes the different characteristics of each application that can be supported by the framework. The hot-spot sub-system uses the method and the information provided by the kernel sub-system and may extend it.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The kernel structure is defined by analyzing the viewpoints design representations to produce a resulting design representation that reflects a structure that is common to all chosen viewpoints. This part of the design approach is based on a domain-dependent semantic analysis of the design diagrams to elicit the common features of the framework design structure, and is formally described in this dissertation.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The elements that are not in the kernel are the ones that vary for each application, and depend on the use of the framework. These elements define the framework hot-spots [17, 20] that must be adapted to each related application. We defined new relationship in object-oriented design, called the hot-spot relationship, to specify all the hot-spots in the system.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The semantics of this new relationship is given by the design patterns essentials [18]. This implies that the hot-spot relationship is in fact a meta-relationship that is implemented through a design pattern that is generated taking into account the hot-spot flexibility requirements. The hot-spot cards guides this generation process, providing a systematic way for generating design patterns based on flexibility properties.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The most common way to instantiate a framework is to inherit from some abstract classes defined in the framework hierarchy and write the code that is called by the framework itself. However, it is not always easy to identify which code and where it should be written since frameworks class hierarchies can be very complex, especially for non-expert users.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefore, the "common" instantiation process is not always the ideal way to describe a particular application. This happens because of several facts:</P>
<UL>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>the language used to build and use the framework is a wide spectrum language, where it is not always easy to express the user intentions;</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>the complexity of framework class hierarchies and the difficulty of finding the points where the code should be written, that are the framework hot-spots or flexible points.</LI></P>
</UL>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The instantiation method proposes a different process, where a particular application is described by domain specific languages (DSLs) [12] that are designed precisely for the framework domain. In this way, the technique basic idea is to capture domain concepts in a DSL, which will help the framework user to build code in an easier way, without worrying about implementation decisions and remaining focused on the problem domain. The specification written in the DSL is translated to the framework instantiation code through the use of transformational systems [16, 4].</P>

<FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A set of desirable properties of a solution determines whether or not the solution is satisfactory. The proposed method to object-oriented frameworks design and instantiation should posses the following properties.</P>
<UL>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>General: it should be general enough to be used in any application domain. This generality will be shown through case studies in different application areas;</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Precise: it should be precisely described, in order to be understood by its users and also to allow the definition of supporting environments. This property will be addressed through the formalization of the method process;</LI></P>
</UL>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposed method provides a new approach for framework design and instantiation based on viewpoints, the hot-spot relationship, and domain specific languages. Currently comparable methods are almost nonexistent or in their infancy. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Relevant results are also expected to emerge from the formalization process, since the use of category theory [11] and object calculus [7] in method formalization may disclose some powerful method properties. Also the derivation of domain specific languages from problem theory [23] and the integration of frameworks and domain specific languages are new research areas not yet been exploited in literature. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposed method will be tested in three important and innovative application domains, in which we also expect to contribute with the design and development of real frameworks.</P>
